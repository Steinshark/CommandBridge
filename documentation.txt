1) Design Overview 
    
    CommandBridge has 4 main functional components to its design.
        1. Showin in "activity_main"    : Home screen to connect to bluetooth device
        2. Showin in "static_display"   : Displays realtime values of vehicle sensors
        3. Showin in "recycler_view"    : Shows a single graph of a sensor displayed
        4. Showin in "recycler_view"    : Shows multiple graphs displayed of sensors 


2) Class description

    1) MainActivity 
        
        Purpose
            Holds all major objects and datastructures.
            All app functionality is controlled from here. 

        Methods 
            onCreate                - set up the environment 
            onCreateOptionsMenu     - set up the options menu 
            onOptionsItemSelected   - responsible for choosing between views.
            onDestroy               - need to close the Bluetooth socket
            connectBluetooth        - used for initiating the conenction between
                                      the bluetooth device and the app. Also initializes 
                                      instances of a "Command", which is the primary class 
                                      responsible for fetching data 
            setStaticDisplayMode    - does the work of setting the display mode to show 
                                      values of the sensors. Called from onOptionsItemSelected.
            setGraphDisplayMode     - used to change the display mode to graphing. Called from
                                      onOptionsItemSelected.
            doNothing               - easter egg 
            cancel                  - overwritten for something...
            onItemClick             - needed for the recycler view 
            startCommandService     - starts the service in the background that constantly fetches 
                                      data from the car 
            updateStaticView        - fetches all values for the display value mode
    2) Command 

        Purpose 
            Holds methods and data for talking between the car and the bluetooth device 
            for a specific sensor. i.e. the speed sensor, or RPM sensor

        Methods
            runCommand              - Grabs the data from the car for that specific command 
                                      and adds it to the class's stored graphing points to be 
                                      graphed later 
            fetchValue              - Grabs data from the car and updates the field in the 
                                      class holding the most updated value for displaying later 

    3) CommandService
        Purpose 
            Runs in the background to fetch sensor data every few seconds 

        Methods
            onBind                  - Needs to be overridden 
            onStartCommand          - Starts the thread that will be used to fetch values from 
                                      the bluetooth device 
            onDestroy               - Used to unregister the broadcast receiver 
            start_graphing          - holds the thread that constantly fetches the data  

    4) RadioButtonDialog
        Purpose 
            Used to select a sensor to graph 
        Methods
            onCreateDialog          - Adds the options to the dialog that the user can pick from 
                                      (different sensor types i.e. RPM, speed, etc...)
            onClick                 - Returns the sensor as a string that will be graphed later  
    
    5) CheckBoxDialog
        Purpose 
            Used to select multiple sensors to graph 
        Methods
            onCreateDialog          - Adds the options to the dialog that the user can pick from 
                                      (different sensor types i.e. RPM, speed, etc...)
            onClick                 - Returns the several sensors as a string that will be graphed later  

    6) TextItemViewHolder, RecyclerAdapter, and interface RecyclerListener
        Purpose 
            Provide the needed items for a recycler viewer. 
            RecyclerView item holds 2 items: a textview (graph title), and a graph

Feature:

The most challenging part for my project will be handling and establishing bluetooth connections. The protocl for this 
was not covered in class, so I am on my own here. I managed to get a working solution that runs the bluetooth BR/EDR 
protocol (essentially all devices that are not bluetooth speakers). I have successfully implemented the API as per the 
Android dveloper docs. My solution has code to do everything up to creating the socket that requests and responses 
will pass through.
